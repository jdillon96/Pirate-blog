This blog is a logbook of a pirate captain. To access the blog you must "embark" in the top left by signing in with Google. The captain can make new entries through the button at the top left. 
To see entries, click on that entries' title on the left nav bar. The main screen will show the entry with its optional image. Certain articles will have various amounts of comments as well. These comments are displayed at the bottom of an article and can be added unto by the captain.
